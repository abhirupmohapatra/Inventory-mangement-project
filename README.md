- Order management (place, modify, and track orders)  
- Inventory management for real-time stock updates  
- Automated billing and receipt generation  
- User-friendly interface for restaurant staff  
- Data persistence for tracking orders and inventory  

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Database:** SQLite (for data storage)  
- **Libraries:** tkinter (for GUI), datetime, sqlite3  

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Use the following command to install any missing dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
